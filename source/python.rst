Python tutorial
===============

Below is a tutorial file that demonstrates the necessary Python syntax for using oTree.

A downloadable version is :download:`here <_static/otree_python.py>`;
you can download then run it in IDLE (which is installed with Python).
You can insert print statements throughout the file and test different modifications make sure that you understand.

There are also many good python tutorials online (such as Codecademy or Learn Python the Hard Way),
but note that some of the material covered in those tutorials is not necessary for oTree programming specifically.
