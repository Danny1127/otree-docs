.. _v0.6


Version 0.6 beta
================

Version 0.6 is in beta.
You can install it like this::

    pip install --upgrade --pre otree-core
    otree resetdb

Note the ``--pre`` flag, which is necessary since oTree 0.6 is a pre-release.
A new pre-release is published frequently,
so it's good to run the above commands every few days,
to get the latest bugfixes.

Here are some changes:

-   The :ref:`rooms <rooms>` feature is more fully developed and functional.
-   Various improvements to the admin interface
-   If you update a template you don't have to reload the server
-   Chinese now uses the proper ``zh-hans`` language code
-   ``runprodserver`` now defaults to port 8000 (before was 5000)
