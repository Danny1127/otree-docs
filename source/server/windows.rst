oTree on Windows Server
=======================

If you are just testing your app on your personal computer, you can use
``otree runserver``. You don't need a full server setup as described below,
which is necessary for sharing your app with an audience.

However, oTree on a Windows server is more complex.
You should first consider using :ref:`Heroku <heroku>`
or :ref:`Linux <server-ubuntu>`,
which is simpler and more tested.


oTree 0.5 setup
---------------

.. note::

    We currently do not have Windows server setup instructions for oTree 0.5+.
    We encourage anybody to contribute instructions.


You should download and run `Redis for Windows <https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releases>`__.
