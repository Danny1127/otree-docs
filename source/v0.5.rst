Version 0.5 pre-release
=======================

If you want you can try the pre-release version of oTree 0.5.
You could try it if you are curious to see the latest development,
or if you are having problems using oTree 0.4.

Note: it's brand new and relatively untested.

What's new
----------

oTree 0.5 has a different architecture based on push and WebSockets,
through use of `Django Channels <https://github.com/andrewgodwin/channels>`__.

It should run faster and support more concurrent players.

There is also a feature called "Rooms" that aims to replace the "Default session" feature,
but that is still under development and not ready yet.

Installation
------------

To install, run this (note the ``--pre`` in the command)::

    pip install --upgrade --pre otree-core
    otree resetdb

You also need to install Redis server and run it on its default port (6379).

- Windows: download and run the `MSI <https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releases>`__.
- Mac: if using Homebrew, you can follow the instructions here: `here <http://richardsumilang.com/server/redis/install-redis-on-os-x/>`__.

You can test if Redis is running as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import redis
    >>> r = redis.Redis()
    >>> r.ping()

Running locally
---------------

If running locally, you can just use ``otree runserver`` as before.

Deploying to Heroku
-------------------

You need to install Heroku's `Redis add-on <https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-redis>`__.

You need to change your ``Procfile`` to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    web: daphne otree.asgi:channel_layer --port $PORT --bind 0.0.0.0 -v2
    worker: python manage.py runworkers

You can also experiment with changing your ``Procfile`` based on the below info.

Downgrading back to oTree stable release
----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip uninstall otree-core
    pip install otree-core
