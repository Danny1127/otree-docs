.. _v0.5


Version 0.5
===========

What's new
----------

oTree 0.5 is now released.

It has a different architecture based on WebSockets.
It runs faster and supports more concurrent players.

It also has a "Server Check" feature in the admin interface
that checks if your server is set up properly.

Installation
------------

Upgrade as usual::

    pip install --upgrade otree-core
    otree resetdb

A new pre-release is published frequently,
so it's good to run the above commands every few days,
to get the latest bugfixes.

Server deployment
-----------------

Redis needs to be installed on your server.
If using Heroku, you should install Heroku's `Redis add-on <https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-redis>`__,
then run ``heroku restart``.

Then update your ``requirements_base.txt`` so it contains the right version of ``otree-core``.
This will tell Heroku which version of oTree to install.
(The currently installed version of ``otree-core`` is listed in the output of ``pip freeze``).

In your project's root directory, find the file ``Procfile``,
change its contents to the following, and if using Heroku, turn on both dynos:

.. code-block:: bash

    web: otree webandworkers
    timeoutworker: otree timeoutworker


Other notes
-----------

There is also a feature called "Rooms" that will replace the "Default session" feature,
but that is still under development and not ready yet.
