Installing oTree (Linux)
========================

If you're installing oTree for development on on your Linux PC,
install the latest Python 3.X using your system's package manager,
then follow the rest of the MacOS installation instructions.

If you're setting up a Linux production server,
see the :ref:`Linux server setup <server-ubuntu>` section.

If ``Twisted`` fails to compile,
install the ``python-dev`` package (e.g. through ``apt-get``).
