PyCharm
-------

To ease the learning curve of oTree, we recommend using
`PyCharm Professional <http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`__, even
though there are many other good editors for Python code. This is
because:

-  PyCharm has features that make oTree/Django development easier
-  oTree has special integration with PyCharm's code completion
   functionality
-  This documentation gives instructions assuming you are using PyCharm
-  oTree has been thoroughly tested with PyCharm

If you are a student, teacher, or professor, PyCharm Professional is
`free <https://www.jetbrains.com/student/>`__. Note: we recommend
PyCharm Professional rather than PyCharm Community Edition.
