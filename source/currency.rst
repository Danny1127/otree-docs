.. _currency:

Money and Points
================

In many experiments, participants play for currency:
either virtual points, or real money. oTree supports both scenarios;
you can switch from points to real money by setting ``USE_POINTS = False``
in ``settings.py``.

You can specify the payment currency in ``settings.py``, by setting
``REAL_WORLD_CURRENCY_CODE`` to "USD", "EUR", "GBP", and so on.
Then all currency amounts will use that currency code.

If you have a value that represents an amount of currency
(either points or dollars, etc),
you should use the ``c()`` function, e.g. ``c(10)`` or ``c(0)``.
It will still work just like a number
(e.g. ``c(1) + c(0.2)`` will result in ``c(1.2)``.
The advantage is that when it's displayed to users, it will automatically
formatted as ``$1.20`` or ``1,20 â‚¬``, etc., depending on your
``REAL_WORLD_CURRENCY_CODE`` and ``LANGUAGE_CODE`` settings.
Money amounts are displayed with 2 decimal places by default;
you can change this with the setting ``REAL_WORLD_CURRENCY_DECIMAL_PLACES``.

If a model field is a currency amount,
you should define it as a ``CurrencyField``:

.. code-block:: python

    class Player(BasePlayer):
        random_bonus = models.CurrencyField()

        def set_random_bonus(self):
            self.random_bonus = c(random.randint(1, 10))

Note: instead of using Python's built-in ``range`` function,
you should use oTree's ``currency_range`` with currency values,
e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    class Player(BasePlayer):
        contribution = models.CurrencyField(
            choices=currency_range(c(0), c(0.10), c(0.02))
        )

In this case, choices will be set to the currency values
[``$0.00``, ``$0.02``, ``$0.04``, ``$0.06``, ``$0.08``, ``$0.10``].

``currency_range`` takes 3 arguments (start, stop, step), just like range.
However, unlike ``range()``, the returned list includes the ``stop`` value
as shown above.

In templates, instead of using the ``c()`` function, you should use the
``|c`` filter.
For example, ``{{ 20|c }}`` displays as ``20 points``.

.. _payoff:

payoffs
-------

Each player has a ``payoff`` field,
which is a ``CurrencyField``.

.. warning::

    Currently, the initial (default) value of ``payoff`` is ``None``,
    but this might change to ``0`` in an upcoming release of oTree.
    If you have any code like ``if self.player.payoff is None``
    that detects whether the payoff has already been set,
    this may not work properly if you upgrade.

If your player makes money, you should store it in this field.
``self.participant.payoff`` is the sum of the payoffs a participant
made in each subsession.
At the end of the experiment, a participant's
total profit can be accessed by ``self.participant.payoff_plus_participation_fee()``
(formerly called ``money_to_pay()``); it is
calculated by converting ``self.participant.payoff`` to real-world currency
(if ``USE_POINTS`` is ``True``), and then adding
``self.session.config['participation_fee']``.

.. _points:

Points (i.e. "experimental currency")
-------------------------------------

Sometimes it is preferable for players to play games for points or
"experimental currency units", which are converted to real money at the
end of the session. You can set ``USE_POINTS = True`` in
``settings.py``, and then in-game currency amounts will be expressed in
points rather than dollars or euros, etc.

For example, ``c(10)`` is displayed as ``10 points``. You can specify
the conversion rate to real money in ``settings.py`` by providing a
``real_world_currency_per_point`` key in the session config dictionary.
For example, if you pay the user 2 cents per point, you would set
``'real_world_currency_per_point': 0.02``.

Points are integers by default. You can change this by setting ``POINTS_DECIMAL_PLACES``
in ``settings.py``.
(e.g. set it to 2 if you want 2 decimal places, so you can get amounts like ``3.14 points``).

You can change the name "points" to something else like "tokens" or "credits", by setting ``POINTS_CUSTOM_NAME``.
(However, if you switch your language setting to one of oTree's supported languages, the name "points" is automatically translated,
e.g. "puntos" in Spanish.)

Converting points to real world currency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can convert a point amount to money using the method
``.to_real_world_currency(self.session)``. In the above example, that would be:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> c(10).to_real_world_currency(self.session)
    $0.20

It requires ``self.session`` to be passed, because
different sessions can have different conversion rates).
